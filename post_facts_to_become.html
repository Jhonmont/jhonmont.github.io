<p class="p-gray">
    Probably most of you've heard about the Harvard Business Review post called: "<a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century</a>", there are other scientific and business media sites support this position considering data science as the best post-modernity job. Most people believe the data professional job only consists building machine learning models, however, this is not 100% true.
</p>
<p class="p-gray">
    Just like me, many people go on to adventure of finding a new career that suits their personal interests, changing market conditions, or simply we discovered a new passion when read about machine learning, so we may have the idea of becoming a data analyst, data scientist, data architect, data engineer, and so on, however, during the learning journey it will be necessary consider some important facts that will allow us to confirm if we are on the right roadmap to be a good data professional.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Continuous Learning</h4>
<p class="p-gray">
    First of all, it'll be necessary adapt the constantly learn idea without rest throughout the career because data science is an extremely broad term, it means many different things for each company, therefore companies from different markets expecting different skills from a data professional, some companies require professionals with machine learning knowledge, some require experimental designs skills, other Python programmers, other R programmers, and so on. Therefore, many skills developed in a specific company or market won't be necessarily a guide in a data professional career. Data science is a multidisciplinary job, and this job require have a good level of programming, statistics, mathematics, business understanding, and so on. That means, a constantly grow in any of these areas. It's very important to consider data science is constantly evolving, that mean current technologies created and tested improve previous processes and models, therefore, is expected from data professional learn those new technologies as well. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>The activities</h4>
<p class="p-gray">
    Many people believe a data professional is constantly working on fun things, such as creating machine learning models, however, this activity is a small fraction of the work, about less than 25% of the time, it's quite likely a data professional dedicates a "long long" time try to understand the data, its origin, its manipulation (ETL), its preparation or analysis (EDA), and so on. A data professional will have evaluate all necessary data to develop a good model, otherwise, will have establish and develop necessary channels to be able get needed data. Model performance is limited by data quality used to create it, therefore it's necessary do more activities in order to, these activities are known in the data science community as, "dirty works", a data professional should be willing to do these dirty works in order to create effective machine learning models, so keep in mind this when decide to venture into data science.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Communication & negotiation</h4>
<p class="p-gray">
    To be a good data professional it's necessary have negotiation skills, a data professional is like a sales representative, it'll be necessary sell ideas and new initiatives to business stakeholders, it's quite likely as data professional be constantly pushing for additional resources, such as new technology, more manpower, more storage, better workflows, and so on. Also it's quite likely have negotiate between short-time delivery and improve models, in some cases, it'll take more time in order to improve them, often the business stakeholders may not see the value of improve models accuracy. Therefore, most of the time a data professional should be a good communicator, that means, transfer knowledge to stakeholders whom have not tech knowledge, it's likely they don't understand concepts and the data professional project is working on. Therefore, one truly important activity in a data professional job is communicate, educate, and help coworkers and stakeholders understand concepts and project purposes for them.
</p>
<p class="p-gray">
    A data professional should consider divide the data projects into multiple steps, often business stakeholders are very concerned about projects progress, they feel a strong need to know how data projects improve over the time rather than waiting long periods of time to get satisfactory results, therefore, it's a responsibility communicate the progress and previous results.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Creativity & Clever</h4>
<p class="p-gray">
    A data professional ain't got much help at the beginning, therefore the responsibility only will fall on him or her to get the job done at end of the day, if for some reason he or she gets stuck, as data professionals will have to be enough creative and cleaver to find answers for questions and drawbacks resolve, if he or she needs to learn about how a specific device works, create an API, and so on, a data professional needs to be cleaver searching from various information sources such as watching videos on YouTube, read documentation, or working on a Bootcamp to fix drawbacks. Besides, a data professional should take the initiative to schedule meetings with relevant stakeholders in order to learn more about business goals, expected results, relevant metrics required, and any other requirements from the machine learning models.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p class="p-gray">
    A good data professional must have the necessary resources to be constantly learning, carry out activities necessary to create models with the best accuracy possible based on the delivery time available, take initiative, be persistent, have the ability to communicate concepts and information, last but not least, be very creative and clever.
